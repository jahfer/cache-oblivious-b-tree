# Summary of work completed

## Step 1: Add `crossbeam-epoch` dependency

- Added `crossbeam-epoch = "0.9"` to `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml
- Project compiles successfully with the new dependency
- Key types to use in subsequent steps:
  - `Atomic<T>`: Lock-free atomic pointer (replaces `AtomicPtr`)
  - `Owned<T>`: Uniquely owned heap allocation
  - `Shared<'g, T>`: Pointer valid for lifetime of a `Guard`
  - `Guard`: Epoch guard that prevents reclamation while held
