# Summary of work completed

## Step 1: Add `crossbeam-epoch` dependency

- Added `crossbeam-epoch = "0.9"` to `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml
- Project compiles successfully with the new dependency
- Key types to use in subsequent steps:
  - `Atomic<T>`: Lock-free atomic pointer (replaces `AtomicPtr`)
  - `Owned<T>`: Uniquely owned heap allocation
  - `Shared<'g, T>`: Pointer valid for lifetime of a `Guard`
  - `Guard`: Epoch guard that prevents reclamation while held

## Step 2: Complete rebalance retry logic

- Wrapped the entire `rebalance()` function body in a labeled loop: `'retry: loop { ... }`
- Replaced `todo!("Restart rebalance!")` at line 283 (version mismatch) with `continue 'retry`
- Replaced `todo!("Restart rebalance!")` at line 305 (CAS failure) with `continue 'retry`
- Changed the function's return from implicit to explicit `return self.compute_affected_blocks(...)` at end of loop
- Note: The plan mentioned "six `todo!()` panics" but only two were found in the actual code
- Added two new tests:
  - `test_rebalance_retry_loop_compiles_and_runs`: Verifies the labeled loop structure is syntactically correct and executes without panicking
  - `test_rebalance_does_not_panic_with_todo`: Exercises the rebalance code path with multiple tree sizes to confirm `todo!()` calls have been replaced
- All 61 tests pass

### Technical notes on the retry logic:

- When version mismatch occurs (cell modified by another thread), the entire rebalance restarts with fresh state
- When CAS failure occurs (marker updated by another thread), the allocated marker is deallocated before retrying
- The retry approach is appropriate because concurrent modifications invalidate the snapshot of which cells need relocation
