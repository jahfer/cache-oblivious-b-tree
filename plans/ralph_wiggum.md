Follow the plan in #file:plan-implicitVebNavigation.prompt.md to complete only ONE step. When complete, write tests to confirm the logic of this step is correct. Only once all tests are passing, cross off the todo in the plan file, and add any notes about what you accomplished for the next contributor to the code to #file:log.md.
