Follow the plan in #file:plan-markerRefactor.json to complete only ONE step. Read #file:log.md to see where the last contributor left off. When complete, write tests to confirm the logic of this step is correct. Only once all tests are passing, set `"passes": true` in #file:plan-markerRefactor.json. You may ONLY set the `"passes"` field in the JSON, and NOTHING else. It is unacceptable to remove or edit tests because this could lead to missing or buggy functionality. Add any notes about what you accomplished for the next contributor to the code to #file:log.md.
